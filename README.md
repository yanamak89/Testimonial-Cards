# Testimonial Cards

This is a beginner-level project from [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/projects/testimonial-cards).  
The goal of the project is to practice **HTML, CSS, Layouts, Flexbox, and Positioning** by building a set of testimonial cards.

## Project Overview

Testimonials are quotes or statements from satisfied customers or users, often used on websites to build credibility and trust.

In this project, I created testimonial card components that can be reused across a website.  
The design demonstrates the use of:

- HTML5 semantic elements (`figure`, `figcaption`, `blockquote`)
- CSS Grid and Flexbox for layouts
- Responsive design principles
- Positioning and styling (speech bubble, outlined cards, split cards, carousel-style card)

## Features

- Dark speech bubble card
- Outlined light card
- Split card with image and rating stars
- Carousel-style centered testimonial card

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3 (Flexbox, Grid, Positioning)
- Responsive design with media queries
